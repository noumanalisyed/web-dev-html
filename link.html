HTML Links

Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:


    <h1>HTML Links</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.codewithharry.com/">Visit CODEWithHarrycom!</a></p>

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

    HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

    The target attribute can have one of the following values:

    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

    <h2>The target Attribute</h2>

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_top">Visit W3Schools!</a>

    <p>If target="_blank", the link will open in a new browser window or tab.</p>

    Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
    Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

    A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

    <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a></p>

    <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
    <p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>


    HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
    To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">
            <img src="simely.jpeg" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
        </a>


        Link to an Email Address
        Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):


        <h2>Link to an Email Address</h2>

        <p>To create a link that opens in the user's email program (to let them send a new email), use mailto: inside the href attribute:</p>

        <p><a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a></p>

        Button as a Link
        To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

        JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

        <h2>Button as a Links</h2>

        <p>Click the button to go to the HTML tutorial.</p>

        <button onclick="document.location='https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>


        <h2>Link Titles</h2>
        <p>The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.</p>
